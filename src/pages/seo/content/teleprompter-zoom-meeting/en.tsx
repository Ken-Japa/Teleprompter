        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">How to Use a Teleprompter for Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet for High-Impact Presentations</h1>

        <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-300 mb-8">
            Maintaining eye contact during an online presentation is the secret to capturing attention and conveying confidence. However, the reality is a constant juggling act: if you look at your notes, you lose connection with the audience; if you look at the camera, you risk forgetting crucial points. PromptNinja emerges as the definitive solution to this dilemma, allowing you to read your script fluently while looking directly at the camera lens, creating powerful and authentic communication.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">The Psychological Problem of the "Wandering Eye" in Video Calls</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            In a digital business environment, trust is the most valuable currency. In important sales meetings, job interviews, or executive presentations, direct eye contact is interpreted by the human brain as a sign of honesty, preparedness, and authority. When your eyes wander to read a script from paper or a side window, you involuntarily project an image of being unprepared, nervous, or even disinterested.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
            The technical solution is elegantly simple, but its execution is crucial: position the text <strong>as close to your webcam as possible</strong>. This minimizes eye movement, making the reading virtually undetectable to the audience.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">Did You Know?</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-300">
                Communication studies indicate that over 55% of a message's impact is conveyed through body language, including eye contact. In video calls, where the body is only partially visible, the eyes carry even greater weight in communication.

        <div className="bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-6 text-slate-300">
                <li>
                    <strong>Strategic Window Positioning:</strong> Open PromptNinja in your browser and resize the window to a narrow strip. Drag it to the top of the screen, centered just below your webcam. A narrow window forces the text to have fewer words per line, reducing horizontal eye movement and making the reading imperceptible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Optimized Text Configuration:</strong> Increase the font size for comfortable reading at a distance and decrease the margin width. This concentrates the text in a smaller area, vertically aligned with the camera, so your eyes only move downwards—a natural and discreet motion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The Invisible Remote Control:</strong> The Achilles' heel of many presenters is their interaction with the computer. The sound of a mouse click or the shoulder movement to reach the keyboard are clear signs that you are operating the machine. PromptNinja eliminates this with its QR Code remote. Your phone becomes a silent and discreet slide advancer, keeping the focus entirely on you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Presenter Mode (Pro Tip):</strong> Need to see slides, the chat, or participants' faces? Don't sacrifice eye contact. Reduce the width of the teleprompter window so it occupies only a thin strip at the top. This way, you can read your script and monitor the meeting simultaneously, like a pro.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Universal Compatibility: Freedom to Present</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
            The beauty of PromptNinja lies in its simplicity and universality. Because it runs directly in the browser, it is independent of any video conferencing platform. There is no need to install plugins, extensions, or deal with complex integrations. It works as a visual layer "above" your meeting, visible only to you.

        <ul className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 mb-6">
            <li className="bg-slate-900 p-3 rounded"><strong>Zoom:</strong> Ideal for webinars, classes, and large audiences.</li>
            <li className="bg-slate-900 p-3 rounded"><strong>Microsoft Teams:</strong> Perfect for the corporate environment and formal presentations.</li>
            <li className="bg-slate-900 p-3 rounded"><strong>Google Meet:</strong> Great for quick calls, interviews, and team meetings.</li>
            <li className="bg-slate-900 p-3 rounded"><strong>Skype, Discord, Slack:</strong> Works perfectly on any application that uses your camera.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-8">
            <strong>Crucial Reminder:</strong> You do <em>not</em> need to share your screen for the teleprompter to work. It is a tool for your eyes only. If you need to show a presentation, share only the specific window (PowerPoint, Google Slides, PDF) and keep PromptNinja floating discreetly at the top, visible only to you.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6">Common Mistakes to Avoid So You Don't Sound Like a Robot</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Monotonous Reading:</strong> The teleprompter is a guide, not a sentence. Use pauses, vary your tone of voice, and add emphasis to sound natural. Breathe!</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Practice:</strong> Never read a script for the first time live. Practice beforehand to familiarize yourself with the flow of the text and mark points of emphasis.</li>
            <li><strong>Inappropriate Speed:</strong> Scrolling too fast creates anxiety; too slow, monotony. Use the remote control to adjust the speed in real-time, matching your speaking pace.</li>
            <li><strong>Forgetting Body Language:</strong> Your eyes are on the camera, but what about the rest of your body? Gesticulate with your hands, smile, and use facial expressions to complement your message.</li>
        </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-purple-400 mb-2">Professional Lighting</h3>
                <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">Good frontal lighting (like a ring light) eliminates shadows and creates a professional appearance. The reflection from the white teleprompter screen can help, but a dedicated light is transformative.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-slate-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-blue-400 mb-2">Camera Angle</h3>
                <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">The camera should be at eye level. If using a laptop, stack books under it. A low camera (filming from below) can convey arrogance, while a very high one can suggest submission.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-slate-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-green-400 mb-2">Audio Quality</h3>
                <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">Bad audio can ruin the best of presentations. Use an external microphone (lavalier or USB) whenever possible. Your message will be heard with clarity and professionalism.</p>

            <div className="bg-slate-900 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-2">Background</h3>
                <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">Choose a neutral and organized background. Avoid windows with too much light or cluttered environments. A tasteful virtual background is also a valid option if your real environment is not ideal.</p>
