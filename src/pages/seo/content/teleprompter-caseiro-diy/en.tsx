        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Homemade Teleprompter DIY: Complete Guide and the Best FREE Software for Your Project</h1>

        <p className="mb-6">
            Recording professional-looking videos requires fluency and confidence, but memorizing scripts is a challenge. Professional teleprompter equipment solves this, but it's expensive. The good news? You can build a DIY teleprompter at home with simple materials and achieve impressive results. The physical principle behind it is "Pepper's Ghost," an optical illusion used in theaters since the 19th century.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Materials Needed for Your DIY Teleprompter</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Glass or Acrylic:</strong> A picture frame (remove the back) or a transparent acrylic sheet. This will be your "beam splitter."</li>
            <li><strong>Support Structure:</strong> A sturdy cardboard box or a lightweight wooden frame. Paint the inside black to prevent unwanted reflections.</li>
            <li><strong>Display Device:</strong> A tablet, smartphone, or portable monitor to display the script.</li>
            <li><strong>Black Cloth:</strong> To create a "tunnel" between the camera lens and the glass, blocking light and ensuring the camera doesn't appear in the reflection.</li>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Any DSLR, mirrorless, or even your smartphone's camera.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Software Challenge: More Than Just Flipped Text</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            After assembling your structure, you'll face the main technical hurdle: when you place the tablet under the glass at a 45-degree angle, the text reflected at you will appear <strong>mirrored and inverted</strong>. Reading it like that is impossible.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
            This is where specialized software becomes essential. But the problems don't stop at mirroring. The solution? Use a <a href="/en/free-online-teleprompter" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300 underline">free online teleprompter</a> like PromptNinja.

            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-white">Do I need special glass?</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-300 mt-2">No. A regular picture frame glass works well. Professional "beam splitter" glass is better, but for a DIY setup, the difference is minimal and the cost is much higher.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-semibold text-white">How do I prevent the camera from recording the text?</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-300 mt-2">The secret is the 45-degree angle of the glass and the black cloth. The camera, positioned behind the glass, captures the image in front of you, while the reflected text from the tablet below is only visible to the person in front of the glass (you).</p>
