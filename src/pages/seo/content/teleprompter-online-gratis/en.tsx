            If you are looking for a simple, fast, and free way to read your scripts while recording videos, you found it.
            <strong>PromptNinja</strong> is an online teleprompter that runs directly in your browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox) without the need to install heavy programs or apps that take up space on your phone.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Why use an Online Teleprompter?</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>No Downloads:</strong> Access and start using immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Universal Compatibility:</strong> Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Sync:</strong> Unlike basic solutions, PromptNinja allows you to control text scrolling using another device (like your phone) as a remote control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">How does PromptNinja work?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
            PromptNinja uses P2P (Peer-to-Peer) technology to connect your devices. This means control is instant and doesn't rely on slow servers.
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Open PromptNinja on your computer (where the text will be displayed).</li>
            <li>Scan the QR Code with your phone.</li>
            <li>Done! Your phone has become a remote control to adjust speed, font size, and start/pause scrolling.</li>
        </ol>
