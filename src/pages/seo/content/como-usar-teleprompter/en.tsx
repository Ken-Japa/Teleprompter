            How to Use a Free Teleprompter: The Ultimate Guide for Professional Videos
        </h2>

        <p className="lead text-xl text-slate-300 mb-8">
            First time trying a teleprompter? You open some random site, paste text, hit play and... DISASTER. Text scrolls too fast (you sound like a nervous auctioneer) or too slow (awkward pauses). You try to pause but need to <strong>touch the screen and shake the camera</strong>. After 40 minutes testing, you give up and go back to re-recording 20 times from memory.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
            EXACTLY what happened to me the first time. I thought "teleprompter will change my life". Result? I spent MORE time fighting the tool than if I'd recorded without anything. The problem wasn't ME. It was using tools made for professional studios with $5000 equipment, not for solo creators recording with a phone.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-8">
            This guide exists so you <strong>get it right the first time</strong>. I'll show you EXACTLY how to use a teleprompter the right way — not just the technical part ("paste text, hit play") but the TRICKS that separate who looks like reading from who looks like speaking naturally.

                90% of creators who test teleprompter for the first time QUIT. Not because the tool doesn't work, but because they make 3 classic mistakes:

                    <p className="text-slate-300 text-sm">
                        They think: "I need to see the text well" and set font size to 72px. Result? Your eyes make a <strong>wide left/right movement</strong> each line. Camera catches it. Audience notices you're reading.
                        <span className="text-green-400 block mt-2">✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Font 28-36px + stand FARTHER from screen. Eyes move less, looks natural.</span>

                        They put teleprompter in one corner of screen, camera in another. You record looking 20º to the SIDE of camera. Audience feels you're not talking to THEM.
                        <span className="text-green-400 block mt-2">✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> Stick teleprompter window LITERALLY over camera. Closer the better.</span>

                        They leave on default (usually too fast). You rush to keep up, run out of breath, lose naturalness. Or too slow: giant awkward pauses.
                        <span className="text-green-400 block mt-2">✅ <strong>Solution:</strong> ALWAYS do a 30s test BEFORE recording. Adjust until it matches your natural speaking. There's no "universal correct speed".</span>

        <p className="text-slate-300 mb-8">
            There are two main ways to use a teleprompter, especially with web-based tools like PromptNinja, which don't require purchasing expensive equipment.
        </p>

        <div className="mb-12 space-y-8">
            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-xl text-white mb-3">Method 1: The Single Device (The Quick Start)</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-400 mb-4">
                    Ideal for beginners or for quick recordings. You use the same device to record and read.

                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-300">
                    <li>Open your phone's camera or your notebook's webcam.</li>
                    <li>In a window next to it, open <strong>PromptNinja</strong> in your browser.</li>
                    <li>Paste your script, adjust the font size and speed.</li>
                    <li>Position the teleprompter window as close as possible to the camera lens.</li>
                    <li>Start recording, then press play on the teleprompter.</li>
                </ol>
                <p className="text-sm text-slate-500 mt-4"><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> It's hard to control the scroll without interrupting the recording or looking away. Works best for short videos.</p>

        <div className="space-y-4">
            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-lg text-white">1. "Dancing" Eyes on the Screen</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-300 mt-2"><strong>The Mistake:</strong> Your eyes visibly move from left to right as you read, giving away that you're using a teleprompter. <br /> <strong>The Solution:</strong> Increase the distance between you and the screen. The farther away you are, the less noticeable the eye movement will be. Also, narrow the width of the text box in the teleprompter so the lines are shorter.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-lg text-white">2. Monotonous and Robotic Rhythm</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-300 mt-2"><strong>The Mistake:</strong> You enter "reading mode" and your voice loses emotion, sounding like a robot. <br /> <strong>The Solution:</strong> Don't write the script like a formal text. Use short sentences, punctuation that indicates pauses, and even notes like "(smile here)" or "(pause here)". Practice reading the text aloud once before recording to find the natural rhythm.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-lg text-white">3. Incorrect Scrolling Speed</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-300 mt-2"><strong>The Mistake:</strong> The scroll is too slow, creating awkward pauses, or too fast, causing you to stumble over your words. <br /> <strong>The Solution:</strong> This is where <strong>PromptNinja's P2P remote control</strong> shines. It allows you to adjust the speed in real-time with zero latency. Start a little slower and speed up as you get into the rhythm. A good tip is to always have the next line visible at the top of the screen.</p>
