            Public Speaking for Video: 7 Tips to Speak Confidently and Connect with Your Audience
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-8 text-lg text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            The red camera light turns on, and suddenly, your mind goes blank. Speaking to a cold glass lens isn't natural and can intimidate even the most seasoned communicators. The good news is that on-camera public speaking isn't a gift, but a skill that can be developed. With the right techniques and the right tools, you can turn your anxiety into authenticity.

                <p className="text-sm">
                    In a conversation, we look into each other's eyes. On video, your audience's eyes are the camera lens. The most common mistake is looking at your own image on the screen. This instantly breaks the connection. Your gaze needs to be fixed and direct at the lens.

                    <p className="text-xs text-slate-400">
                        A teleprompter like <strong>PromptNinja</strong> displays your script in front of the lens, allowing you to read while maintaining perfect, natural eye contact.

                <p className="text-sm">
                    "Umm...", "like...", "you know?". These fillers appear when the brain is searching for the next word. They undermine your credibility and distract the viewer. Verbal fluency demonstrates authority on the subject.

                <p className="text-sm">
                    The camera tends to "flatten" your energy. What seems normal in person can appear monotonous on video. Project your voice, gesture, and smile a bit more than you normally would. Think about raising your energy by 10 to 20%.
                </p>

                    <p className="text-xs text-slate-400">
                        By freeing your mind from the task of memorizing, you can focus 100% on your delivery, energy, and body language. The teleprompter takes care of the text.

            <p className="text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto">
                Trying to remember a script, control the camera, think about lighting, and still appear natural is a recipe for disaster. This is called high cognitive load. It's when your brain is overloaded with multiple complex tasks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-4">
                The most effective tool to reduce this load is a teleprompter. It removes the heaviest task – memorization – allowing your mind to focus on what truly matters: <strong>connecting with your audience.</strong>

                        On the contrary. A good teleprompter, combined with good speed control (like PromptNinja's remote), allows you to speak at your natural pace. The robotic appearance comes from trying to memorize and recite, not from reading fluently.
