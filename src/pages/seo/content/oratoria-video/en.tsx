            Speaking to a cold glass lens is not natural. Even great speakers freeze when the "REC" light turns on. The good news is that video charisma is a trainable skill.

        <h2>1. The Power of Eye Contact</h2>
        <p>
            In a real conversation, we look into eyes. In video, the "eye" is the camera lens.
            Many creators make the mistake of looking at the phone screen (to see themselves) or to the side. This breaks the connection with the viewer.

            <h4 className="text-white font-bold mb-2">Pro Tip</h4>
            <p className="mb-0">
                Use a Teleprompter. It projects the text directly in front of the lens, allowing you to read while maintaining perfect eye contact with your audience.

        <h2>2. Eliminate Filler Words</h2>
        <p>
            "Umm...", "Like...", "You know?". These filler sounds happen when your brain is searching for the next word.
            When you have a well-written script scrolling in front of you, your brain doesn't need to "search" for anything. You just deliver the message fluidly.
        </p>

        <h2>3. The Energy + 10% Rule</h2>
        <p>
            The camera "steals" part of your energy. What seems normal live, seems lifeless on video. When recording, try to raise your energy and intonation by 10% to 20% above normal.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Prepare a Script</h2>
        <p>
            Improvisation is the enemy of retention. The most watched YouTube videos are scripted word for word.
            This ensures that you get straight to the point and respect the viewer's time.
