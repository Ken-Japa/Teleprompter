            How to Speak Confidently and Connect with Your Audience
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8 text-lg text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            The red camera light turns on, and suddenly, your mind goes blank. Speaking to a cold glass lens isn't natural and can intimidate even the most seasoned communicators. The good news is that on-camera public speaking isn't a gift, but a skill that can be developed. With the right techniques and the right tools, you can turn your anxiety into authenticity. If you don't have a tool yet, <a href="/en/teleprompter-alternatives" className="text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300 underline">check out the best free alternative to Teleprompter Pro here</a>.

                <p className="text-sm">
                    In a conversation, we look into each other's eyes. On video, your audience's eyes are the camera lens. The most common mistake is looking at your own image on the screen. This instantly breaks the connection. Your gaze needs to be fixed and direct at the lens.

                    <p className="text-xs text-slate-400">
                        <strong>PromptNinja's</strong> resizable window allows you to position the text exactly over your camera area (on Zoom or desktop). This keeps your eyes aligned with the lens naturally while reading.

                <p className="text-sm">
                    "Umm...", "like...", "you know?". These fillers appear when the brain is searching for the next word. They undermine your credibility and distract the viewer. Verbal fluency demonstrates authority on the subject.

                        With the script scrolling smoothly on the screen, your brain doesn't need to "hunt" for words. <strong>PromptNinja</strong> ensures your message is delivered cleanly and professionally.

                <p className="text-sm">
                    The camera tends to "flatten" your energy. What seems normal in person can appear monotonous on video. Project your voice, gesture, and smile a bit more than you normally would. Think about raising your energy by 10 to 20%.
                </p>

                    <p className="text-xs text-slate-400">
                        By freeing your mind from the task of memorizing, you can focus 100% on your delivery, energy, and body language. The teleprompter takes care of the text.

                <p className="text-sm">
                    Silence is as important as speech. Strategic pauses give the audience time to absorb information and create anticipation. Don't rush. Use the commas and periods in your script as moments to breathe and let the message shine.
                </p>

                <p className="text-sm">
                    Crossing your arms or hunching your shoulders conveys insecurity. Keep your shoulders relaxed and open. Use your hands to emphasize important points, but avoid repetitive movements that distract. Taking up space conveys confidence.

            <p className="text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto">
                Trying to remember a script, control the camera, think about lighting, and still appear natural is a recipe for disaster. This is called high cognitive load. It's when your brain is overloaded with multiple complex tasks.
            </p>
            <p className="text-center max-w-2xl mx-auto mt-4">
                The most effective tool to reduce this load is a teleprompter. It removes the heaviest task – memorization – allowing your mind to focus on what truly matters: <strong>connecting with your audience.</strong>
