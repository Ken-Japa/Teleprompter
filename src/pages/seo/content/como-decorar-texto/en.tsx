            Actors spend years training their memory. But you, who need to record a YouTube video or an online class for tomorrow, don't have that time. How to solve it?
        </p>

        <h2>The Myth of "Rote Memorization"</h2>
        <p>
            Trying to memorize word for word is the most inefficient way to record. Besides being time-consuming, it makes your speech robotic. When you forget a word, you freeze and have to start all over again.
        </p>

        <h2>Technique 1: Keywords (Topics)</h2>
        <p>
            Instead of memorizing entire sentences, memorize the logical structure.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Introduction (Hook)</li>
            <li>Problem</li>
            <li>Solution</li>
            <li>Call to Action</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Technique 2: The Definitive Solution (Don't Memorize!)</h2>
        <p>
            Why spend 4 hours memorizing a 10-minute script if you can simply read it?
            TV has used teleprompters since the 50s. Today, you can have this technology in your pocket.

        <h3>Advantages of Reading vs. Memorizing:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Precision:</strong> You say exactly what you planned, without forgetting important details.</li>
            <li><strong>Time:</strong> Write and record immediately. Zero memorization time.</li>
            <li><strong>Editing:</strong> Fewer mistakes means less time cutting videos in editing.</li>
        </ul>
