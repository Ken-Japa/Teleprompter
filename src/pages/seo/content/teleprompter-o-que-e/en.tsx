        <h2>What is a Teleprompter?</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>teleprompter</strong> (also known as an "autocue") is a display device that prompts the person speaking with an electronic visual text of a speech or script. Using a teleprompter allows the presenter to read the script while looking directly into the camera lens. This creates the illusion that the speaker has memorized the speech or is speaking spontaneously, enhancing connection with the audience and authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally exclusive to TV news studios, teleprompters are now essential tools for YouTubers, content creators, educators, and public speakers who want to record professional videos without the stress of memorizing long scripts.

        <h2>How Does a Teleprompter Work?</h2>
        <p>
            There are generally two main types of setups:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Mirror Teleprompter (Hardware):</strong> Uses a beam-splitter glass placed in front of the camera lens. A monitor or tablet sits below the glass, projecting the scrolling text upwards. The glass reflects the text to the presenter but remains transparent to the camera.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Digital Teleprompter (Software/App):</strong> This is an application or website (like PromptNinja) that scrolls text directly on your computer or mobile screen. You simply place your camera as close to the scrolling text as possible to simulate eye contact.
            </li>
        </ul>
