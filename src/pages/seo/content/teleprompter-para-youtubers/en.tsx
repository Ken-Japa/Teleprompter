        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Quick Text Editing:</strong> Paste your script and adjust the font size for comfortable reading from a distance.</li>
            <li><strong>No App on Camera:</strong> Use your laptop as the main screen and your phone just to control the speed.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Control (Pro):</strong> The text scrolls automatically as you speak (advanced feature).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Ideal for Home Studio Setups</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
            If you record alone at home, you know how annoying it is to have to get up to adjust the equipment. With PromptNinja's Wi-Fi remote control, you sit in the chair, set up the lighting, and control everything from the phone in your hand.
