        <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-slate-300">
            If you're a YouTuber, you know that content quality goes far beyond a good camera or lighting. Your ability to communicate clearly, confidently, and directly with your audience is what truly creates a connection. But maintaining eye contact and a natural flow of speech while trying to remember a complex script is one of the biggest challenges in video production.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">The Vicious Cycle of Script-Free Recording</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
                Recording without a teleprompter often results in a frustrating cycle: you start talking, forget a crucial part, stop the recording, take a deep breath, and try again. Repeat this dozens of times, and a 10-minute video takes hours to shoot. The result? Material full of cuts, hesitations, and a gaze that constantly shifts away from the camera, breaking the connection with the viewer.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where a <strong>teleprompter for YouTubers</strong> ceases to be a luxury and becomes an essential tool for productivity and professionalism. It allows you to read your script smoothly while maintaining eye contact and naturalness, as if you were having a direct conversation with your audience.

        <p className="mb-4">
            Imagine this scenario: you're in your studio, the camera is set, the lighting is perfect. Now, instead of stressing over the script, you follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Open Your Browser:</strong> On your laptop or tablet positioned near the camera, go to the PromptNinja website. No installation is required.</li>
            <li><strong>Paste Your Script:</strong> Copy and paste your script directly onto the screen. Adjust the font size and margins for comfortable reading from your recording position.</li>
            <li><strong>Activate Remote Control:</strong> With one click, generate a QR Code. Scan it with your phone's camera.</li>
            <li><strong>Full Control in Your Hand:</strong> Your phone is now a remote control. Sit down, frame yourself in the camera, and use your thumb to start, pause, and adjust the text scrolling speed. You'll never have to get up during a recording session again.</li>
            <li><strong>(Pro) Activate Voice Control:</strong> For maximum fluency, the Pro version allows the text to scroll automatically as you speak, pausing when you pause. It's the most natural teleprompter experience possible.</li>
        </ol>

        <div className="space-y-4">
            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-white">Will people notice I'm reading?</h3>
                <p>Not if used correctly. The secret is to position the teleprompter screen as close to the camera lens as possible. With PromptNinja, you can adjust the font size and margins so your eye movement is minimal, making the reading unnoticeable.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-white">Do I need expensive teleprompter hardware?</h3>
                <p>No! You can start by using a laptop, tablet, or even a second monitor positioned above or below your camera. If you later invest in teleprompter hardware (with mirrored glass), PromptNinja has a free <strong>Mirror Mode</strong> that flips the text for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="bg-slate-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h3 className="font-bold text-white">Does the remote work on any phone?</h3>
                <p>Yes. The remote control works on any smartphone (iPhone or Android) with a camera and an internet browser. The connection is via WebRTC (P2P), which makes it instantaneous and doesn't require the devices to be on the same Wi-Fi network.</p>
